# Cube64-DX #

[Cube64](http://cia.vc/stats/project/navi-misc/cube64) is an project originally developed by Micah Dowty in 2004. The goal was to build an adapter to make possible the use of GC controller on N64 system since the N64 controller analog is rather bad. Another goal was to make a rather complete reverse engineering of both N64 and NGC controller protocol.

I've been using the original Cube64 since 2005 and I'm very satisfied. But their is some bugs with some games. Also I think that some new feature could make the adapter even better. The original project is so well documented that it make it easy to the understand the original source code. Micah did an awesome job! So Cube64-DX is Cube64 with bug fix and new feature!
